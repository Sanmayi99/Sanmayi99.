Cricket Data Analysis and Score Prediction
This project focuses on analyzing historical cricket data and implementing machine learning models to predict match outcomes and scores. Using data from One Day International (ODI) matches spanning several decades, the analysis explores team performance trends, player statistics, and venue-specific factors. Data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features were applied to ensure data quality. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helped identify key patterns, such as win probabilities based on past performances and batting trends across different stadiums. Feature engineering was employed to enhance predictive accuracy by incorporating factors like recent form and team composition.  

Multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting Machines, were trained to predict match outcomes. Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques were used to optimize performance. The evaluation process, based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, revealed that ensemble models performed best in predicting match results. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of data-driven insights in cricket analytics, providing valuable information for teams, analysts, and enthusiasts. The complete implementation and results can be explored in the linked Kaggle notebook.
